I have a lot of ideas.

 Here are a few I've been able to bring to life:


1. ARK DATA STUDIOS - My Sole Proprietorship- [arkdatastudios](https://lens.page/arkdatastudios.com)

1. HANDS ON KEYS - My tech blog - [handsonkeys.info](https://handsonkeys.info/)

1. Parquet773 - My Gaming Channel - [Parquet773 on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Parquet773)


# GitHub Work

I *love* to code. It's art to me.

Here are some of my favorite coding projects I'm developing:


1. Animations with Manim - [Animate-With-Manim](https://github.com/noah-pitts/Animate-With-Manim)

1. Sattelite Image Timelapses - [Satellite-Image-Timelapse](https://github.com/noah-pitts/Satellite-Image-Timelapse)

1. Newcomers Introduction to the Cloud - [Welcome-to-the-Cloud](https://github.com/noah-pitts/Welcome-to-the-Cloud)

1. *ARK DATA STUDIOS Website (Only works on desktop for now) - [arkdatastudios.com](https://arkdatastudios.com/)

# Other Work

I'm also learning to draw and write.


Scripts, articles, announcements, movies, product updates, and ***so much more***...

Here is a drawing I made about myself:

I will continue to work and share my progress as we move through time.

# *ARK DATA STUDIOS Website 

ARKDATASTUDIOS.com is currently a Desktop only experience.

 It was inspired by [oklama.com](https://oklama.com/):

While I have the base functinality working, there is still work to do in terms of making the site ***mobile-friendly***

For now, my [LENS page](https://lens.page/arkdatastudios.com) will be my "main website", so check that out if you get a chance!
